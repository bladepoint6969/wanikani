# WaniKani API

[![CI]][Actions] [![Latest Version]][crates.io] [![Documentation]][docs.rs] ![License]

`wanikani-api` provides a type-safe async client and object model for version
`20170710` of the [WaniKani REST API](https://docs.api.wanikani.com/20170710/).

Each component of the object model is contained in a feature, meaning you have
the option of excluding the parts you don't need. The HTTP client itself is also
behind a feature, meaning you don't need to include it if you're only going to
be consuming locally cached data.

The API client uses [`reqwest`] to perform the HTTP requests. For convenience,
`reqwest` is re-exported in

## Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
wanikani-api = "0.1"
```

## Features

By default, the API client and all object models are included. Components can be
activated individually by setting `default-features` to `false` and specifiying
the ones you want. Note that if you do this and include the `client` feature,
you will also need to select a TLS implementation. The default is your
system-native implementation (inherited from `reqwest`) with `default-tls`, but
a pure Rust implementation is available with `rustls-tls`.

If the `client` feature is active along any of the object model features,
corresponding fetch (and update where appropriate) methods will be unlocked as
well.

* `client`: The HTTP client implementation. If activated, a TLS implementation
  feature must be activated as well.

* `default-tls`: Activates `reqwest`'s default (native) TLS implementation.

* `rustls-tls`: Activates `reqwest`'s Rustls TLS implementation.

* `model`: Activates all of the below object models.

* `assignment`: Unlocks the assignment object model.

* `lesson_order_sort`: Enables functionality for sorting subjects according to
  a user's preferred lesson presentation order.

* `level_progression`: Unlocks the level progression object model.

* `reset`: Activates the reset object model.

* `view_statistic`: Activates the review statistic object model.

* `study_material`: Activates the study material object model.

* `subject`: Activates the subject object models (radicals, kanji, and
  vocabulary).

* `summary`: Activates the summary report object model.

* `user`: Activates the user report object model.

* `voice_actor`: Activates the voice actor object model.
