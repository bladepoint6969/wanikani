//! Subjects are the radicals, kanji, vocabulary, and kana_vocabulary that are
//! learned through lessons and reviews. They contain basic dictionary
//! information, such as meanings and/or readings, and information about their
//! relationship to other items with WaniKani, like their level.
//!
//! ## Markup highlighting
//!
//! One or many of these attributes can be present in `radical`, `kanji`, and
//! `vocabulary`:
//!
//! - `meaning_mnemonic`
//! - `reading_mnemonic`
//! - `meaning_hint`
//! - `reading_hint`
//!
//! The strings can include a WaniKani specific markup syntax. The following is
//! a list of markup used:
//!
//! - `<radical></radical>`
//! - `<kanji></kanji>`
//! - `<vocabulary></vocabulary>`
//! - `<meaning></meaning>`
//! - `<reading></reading>`
